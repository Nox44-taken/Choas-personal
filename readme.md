Just like the other choas scripts, this is also a working bubblegum project with a twist of my own. 
Massive thanks to the makers of hhe following scripts
-True Auto Stats, Story Arc Engine, Auto Cards, ReputeX, System requests,
-Simplified time input & Text formatter from dynamic worlds, Epoch time script,
-narrative guidance overhaul, Random events, Paragragh fix script.

Personal changes added
-epoch is present but for future intergration maybe. for now it just runs normally without affecting other scripts.
-simplified time input was intergrated with sae but i felt like it arc recognition pattern was inefficient for long arcs. 
for example if you are generating a new arc every 300+ turns, it wasnt robust enough so the old sae of deleting items after a specified number of turns was better.
ideally, if both logics could run at the same time then it would be better so i returned the original sae
-added mp and ep heal to regualar skill and talent based healing
